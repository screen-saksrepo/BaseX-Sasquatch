00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:06.960
Today after two years of negotiations
the United States together with our international

 00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.960
partners has achieved something that decades
of animosity has not a comprehensive

 00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:19.430
long term deal with Iran that
will prevent it from obtaining a nuclear weapon.

 00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.000
This deal demonstrates that American diplomacy can
bring about real and meaningful change

 00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:30.150
change that makes our country and the world safer and
more secure. This deal is also

 00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.270
in line with a tradition of American leadership
. It's now more than 50

 00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.880
years since President Kennedy stood before the American
people and said Let us never negotiate

 00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:46.150
out of fear but let us never fear to negotiate
. He was speaking then about

 00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:51.250
the need for discussions between the United States and the Soviet
Union which led to efforts to restrict

 00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.910
the spread of nuclear weapons. In those
days the risk was a catastrophic nuclear

 00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.310
war between two superpowers
in our time.

 00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:05.380
The risk is that nuclear weapons will spread to
more and more countries particularly in

 00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:10.650
the Middle East the most volatile region
in our world. Today

 00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.400
.
Because America negotiated from a position

 00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.230
of strength and principle. We
have stopped the spread of nuclear weapons in this

 00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:25.330
region. Because of this deal
the international community will be able to verify

 00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.800
.
That the Islamic Republic of Iran will not develop

 00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:35.800
a nuclear weapon.
This deal meets every single one of the bottom lines

 00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.520
that we established when we achieved a framework earlier
this spring. Every pathway

 00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:46.280
to a nuclear weapon is cut off
and the inspection and transparency regime necessary

 00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.650
to verify that objective. Will be put
in place. Because

 00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:56.810
of this deal Iran will not produce the highly enriched
uranium and weapons grade plutonium that

 00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:02.150
form the raw materials necessary for a nuclear bomb
. Because of this deal

 00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.670
Iran will remove two thirds of
its installed centrifuges the machines necessary

 00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.250
to produce highly enriched uranium for a bomb
.

 00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:16.200
And store them under constant international
supervision. Iran will not

 00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.990
use its advanced centrifuges to produce enriched uranium
for the next decade. Iran will also

 00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:27.200
get rid of 98 percent of its stockpile
of enriched uranium. To put

 00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.690
that in perspective Iran currently has a stockpile
that could produce up to 10 nuclear weapons.

 00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.940
Because of this deal that stockpile will be reduced
to a fraction of what would be required

 00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.910
for a single weapon. This stockpile
limitation will last for 15 years.

 00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.690
Because of this deal Iran will modify the
core of its reactor in Iraq. So that it

 00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.210
will not produce weapons grade plutonium
.

 00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:58.300
And it has agreed to ship the spent fuel from
the reactor out of the country for the lifetime of

 00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:03.220
the reactor for at least the
next 15 years. Iran will not build

 00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:09.720
any new heavy water reactors.
Because of this deal we will for the first time be

 00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.560
in a position to verify all of these commitments
.

 00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.900
That means this deal is not built on trust.
It is built on verification.

 00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.670
Inspectors will have 24/7 access
to Iran's key nuclear facilities.

 00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.810
Iran will have access to Iran's entire nuclear
supply chain. Its uranium mines

 00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:35.300
and mills its conversion facility
and its centrifuge manufacturing and storage

 00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:40.210
facilities this ensures that
Iran will not be able to divert materials from known

 00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:45.310
facilities to covert ones.
Some of these transparency measures will be in place

 00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:51.370
for 25 years.
Because of this deal inspectors will also be able to access

 00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:56.920
any suspicious location.
Put simply the organization responsible for the inspections

 00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.280
.
The IAEA will have access where

 00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.740
necessary when necessary.
That arrangement is permanent.

 00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:11.300
And the IAEA has also reached an agreement
with Iran to get access that it needs

 00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:16.570
to complete its investigation into the possible military
dimensions of Iran's past nuclear research

 00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:21.970
. Finally Iran is permanently
prohibited from pursuing a nuclear weapon under

 00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:27.520
the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Which
provided the basis for the international community's efforts

 00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:33.210
to apply pressure on Iran.
As Iran takes steps to implement this deal

 00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.940
it will receive relief from the sanctions that we put in place
because of Iran's nuclear program.

 00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:44.840
Both America's own sanctions and sanctions imposed
by the United Nations Security Council.

 00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:51.170
This relief will be phased in. Iran must
complete key nuclear steps before

 00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:56.210
it begins to receive new sanctions relief.
And over the course of the next decade

 00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:02.270
Iran must abide by the deal
before additional sanctions are lifted including

 00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:07.640
five years for restrictions related to arms
and eight years for restrictions related to ballistic

 00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:12.720
missiles. All of this will
be memorialized and endorsed in a new

 00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.670
United Nations Security Council resolution.
And if Iran violates the deal.

 00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:21.660
All these sanctions will snap back into place
.

 00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:27.810
So there's a very clear incentive for Iran to follow through.
And there are very real consequences for a violation

 00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:32.570
.
That's the deal. It has the full backing

 00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:37.890
of the international community. Congress
will now have an opportunity to review the details

 00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:42.960
and my administration stands ready to provide extensive
briefings on how this will move forward.

 00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:49.630
As the American people and Congress review the deal.
It will be important to consider the alternative

 00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:53.730
. Consider what happens in a world
without this deal.

 00:05:55.540 --> 00:06:00.700
Without this deal there is no scenario where the world
joins us in sanctioning Iran until

 00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:06.160
it completely dismantles its nuclear program
. Nothing we know about the Iranian government

 00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.950
suggests that it would simply capitulate under that kind of pressure
.

 00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:14.200
And the world would not support an effort to permanently
sanction Iran into submission.

 00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:19.870
We put sanctions in place to get a diplomatic resolution
and that is what we have done.

 00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:26.200
Without this deal there would be no agreed upon limitations
for the Iranian nuclear program

 00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:32.140
Iran could produce operate and test more
and more centrifuges. Iran could

 00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:35.670
fuel a reactor capable of producing plutonium
for a bomb.

 00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:41.270
And we would not have any of the inspections that allow us
to detect a covert nuclear weapons program

 00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:46.310
. In other words
no deal means no lasting constraints on

 00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:51.460
Iran's nuclear program.
Such a scenario would make it more likely.

 00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.280
That other countries in the region would feel compelled to pursue
their own nuclear programs threatening

 00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:02.650
a nuclear arms race in the most volatile region
of the world. It would also present

 00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:08.560
the United States with fewer and less effective options
to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear

 00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:13.750
weapon. I've
been president and commander in chief for over six

 00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:19.800
years now. Time and again I have
faced decisions about whether or not to use military

 00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:23.170
force. It's the gravest decision
that any president has to make.

 00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:30.370
Many times in multiple countries
I have decided to use force and I will never

 00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:36.170
hesitate to do so when it is in our national security
interest. I strongly

 00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:39.440
believe that our national security interest
now.

 00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:45.200
Depends upon preventing Iran from obtaining
a nuclear weapon. Which means that

 00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:50.470
without a diplomatic resolution.
Either I or a future U.S. president.

 00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:56.830
Would face a decision about whether or not to allow Iran
to obtain a nuclear weapon or whether to use

 00:07:56.830 --> 00:08:03.170
our military to stop.
Put simply no deal means a greater chance

 00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:09.680
of more war in the Middle East.
Moreover we give nothing up by testing

 00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:14.650
whether or not this problem can be solved peacefully
. If

 00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:20.890
in a worst case scenario Iran violates the deal.
The same options that are available to me today will

 00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:26.180
be available to any U.S. president in the future
. And I have no doubt that 10

 00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:31.880
or 15 years from now the person who holds this office
will be in a far stronger position

 00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:37.670
with Iran further away from a weapon.
And with the inspections and transparency that

 00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:43.000
allow us to monitor the Iranian program
. For this reason

 00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:49.500
I believe it would be irresponsible to
walk away from this deal. But

 00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:54.510
on such a tough issue. It is important
that the American people and their representatives in Congress

 00:08:54.810 --> 00:09:00.770
get a full opportunity to review the deal.
After all the details matter. And we've

 00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:05.300
had some of the finest nuclear scientists in the world
working through those details.

 00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:11.820
And we're dealing with a country Iran that has
been a sworn adversary of the United States for over 35

 00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:17.350
years. So I welcome
a robust debate in Congress on this issue and I welcome

 00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:23.910
scrutiny of the details of this agreement.
But I will remind Congress that you don't make deals

 00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:29.320
like this with your friends.
We negotiated arms control agreements with the Soviet Union

 00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:34.840
when that nation was committed to our destruction.
And those agreements ultimately made us safer

 00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:38.700
.
I am confident that this deal will meet the national

 00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:43.470
security interests of the United States. And our
allies. So I will veto

 00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:48.180
any legislation that prevents the successful
implementation of this deal.

 00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:55.320
We do not have to accept an inevitable
spiral into conflict and we

 00:09:55.590 --> 00:10:01.400
certainly shouldn't seek it. And precisely
because the stakes are so high. This is not

 00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:07.170
the time for politics or posturing.
Tough talk from Washington does not solve problems.

 00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:13.630
Hardnosed diplomacy. Leadership
that has united the world's major powers.

 00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:18.910
Offers a more effective way to verify that
Iran is not pursuing a nuclear weapon

 00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:21.430
.
Now.

 00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:27.560
That doesn't mean that this deal will resolve all of our differences
with Iran. We share

 00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:32.120
the concerns expressed by many of our friends in the Middle
East including Israel and the Gulf states

 00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:37.420
about Iran's support for terrorism and its use
of proxies to destabilize the region.

 00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:44.730
But that is precisely why we are taking this step.
Because an Iran armed with a nuclear weapon would be far

 00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:48.960
more destabilizing and far more dangerous
to our friends and to the world.

 00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:55.870
Meanwhile we will maintain our own
sanctions related to Iran's support for terrorism

 00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:59.110
its ballistic missile program and its human rights violations
.

 00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:05.360
We will continue our unprecedented efforts to
strengthen Israel's security. Efforts

 00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:10.440
that go beyond what any American administration has
done before. And we will continue

 00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:16.560
the work we began at Camp David to elevate our partnership
with the Gulf states to strengthen their capabilities

 00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:22.200
to counter threats from Iran or terrorist groups
like ISIS. However

 00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:27.360
I believe that we must continue to test whether
or not this region which has known

 00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:29.910
so much suffering. So much bloodshed
.

 00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:36.870
Can move in a different direction.
Time and again I have made clear to the Iranian people

 00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:42.680
that we will always be open to engagement
on the basis of mutual interests and mutual respect

 00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:47.880
. Our differences are real
. And the difficult history between our

 00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:52.480
nations cannot be ignored.
But it is possible to change.

 00:11:53.770 --> 00:12:00.250
The path of violence and rigid ideology
a foreign policy based on threats to attack your neighbors

 00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:05.280
or eradicate Israel. That's a dead
end. A different path.

 00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:08.820
One of tolerance and peaceful resolution of conflict
.

 00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:12.420
Leads to more integration into the global economy
.

 00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:18.420
More engagement with the international community
and the ability of the Iranian people to prosper

 00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:24.140
and thrive. This deal offers
an opportunity to move in a new direction

 00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:28.260
. We should seize it
.

 00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:33.690
We have come a long way to reach this point.
Decades of an Iranian nuclear program.

 00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:39.480
Many years of sanctions and many months of
intense negotiation. Today

 00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:44.790
I want to thank the members of Congress from both parties
who helped us put in place the sanctions that have proven

 00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:49.930
so effective as well as the other countries
who joined us in that effort. I want to

 00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:53.200
thank our negotiating partners. The United
Kingdom.

 00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:58.990
France Germany Russia China
as well as the European Union for our unity in

 00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:04.630
this effort which showed that the world
can do remarkable things when we share a vision

 00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:10.300
of peacefully addressing complex.
We showed what we can do when we do not split

 00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:16.210
apart. And finally I want to thank
the American negotiating team. We had a team

 00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:21.690
of experts working for several weeks straight
on this including our Secretary of Energy Ernie Moroni's

 00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:28.480
and I want to particularly thank John Kerry
our secretary of state. Who began his service

 00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:33.640
to this country more than four decades ago.
When he put on our uniform and went off to war.

 00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:40.700
He's now making this country safer through his commitment to strong
principled American diplomacy.

 00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:47.260
History shows that America must lead not just
with our might. But with our principles

 00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.390
.
It shows we are stronger not when we are alone

 00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:55.200
but when we bring the world together
.

 00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:59.890
Today's announcement marks one more chapter
in this pursuit. Of a safer.

 00:14:00.490 --> 00:14:03.100
And more helpful. More hopeful world
.
